                 <p><strong>Taylor Alison Swift</strong> (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_albums_discography">Her discography</a> spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting—often inspired by her personal life—has received critical praise and widespread media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music">country music</a>. She signed a songwriting contract with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005, before releasing her eponymous debut studio album in 2006.</p>

                 <p>Swift explored <u>country pop</u> on the albums Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010); the success of the singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" on both country and pop radio established her as a leading crossover artist. She experimented with rock and electronic genres on her fourth studio album, Red (2012), supported by the singles <em>"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"</em> and <em>"I Knew You Were Trouble"</em>. Swift eschewed country on her synth-pop album 1989 (2014) and its chart-topping tracks "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". The media scrutiny on Swift's life inspired Reputation (2017), which drew from urban sounds. Led by "Look What You Made Me Do", <strong><u>the album made Swift the only act in MRC Data history to have four albums each sell over a million copies in a week.</u></strong></p>
